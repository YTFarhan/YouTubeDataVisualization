# YouTubeDataVisualization

Created data visualizations of popular YouTube channels using Python, Pandas, Plotly Express, and Google Colab. Made a histogram to look at subscriber counts, a pie chart to compare video categories, and a box plot to find patterns in the years that creators started YouTubing.
